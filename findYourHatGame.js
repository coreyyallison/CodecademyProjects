//The find your hat game! This javascript file is a terminal game that allows the user to move through a path (array) while avoiding
//holes or going out of bounds of the array. Once you make it to the hat (^) character you win! The main goal of this game was to work
//on utalising class methods as well as the 'require' and 'prompt-sync' methods to get used to user input.
